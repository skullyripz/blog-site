# A simple blog engine using Wagtail

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

## Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

* Pillow
* Wagtail

## Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

First, create the virtualenv
`$ virtualenv myvenv`

Then, install Pillow and Wagtail

`$ pip install Pillow`
`$ pip install wagtail`

## Deployment

I use the same method for deployment, but remember to change debug to `False` in production
